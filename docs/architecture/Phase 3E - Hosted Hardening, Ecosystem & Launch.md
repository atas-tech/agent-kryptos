# Phase 3E: Hosted Hardening, Ecosystem & Launch

Phase 3E picks up after the core operator dashboard and admin workflows are in place. This phase hardens the hosted product for broader use, adds the ecosystem and documentation work needed for adoption, and closes with the actual hosted go-live path.

The workspace-scoped PostgreSQL policy engine that was once bundled into Phase 3E is now tracked separately in [Hosted Workspace Policy Foundation](Hosted%20Workspace%20Policy%20Foundation.md). Phase 3E assumes that foundation already exists and focuses on session hardening, abuse controls, analytics, ecosystem work, and launch readiness.

This phase is intentionally separate from:

- **Phase 3B**: core operator dashboard and admin UX
- **Phase 3C**: paid guest requester flows
- **Phase 3D**: autonomous payments and crypto billing

**Prerequisites**:

- Phase 3A hosted platform is complete
- Phase 3B operator dashboard and recurring billing admin UX are complete
- [Hosted Workspace Policy Foundation](Hosted%20Workspace%20Policy%20Foundation.md) is complete
- Hosted APIs are stable enough to publish SDKs and onboarding docs

**Development strategy**: land hosted session hardening and abuse controls first, then analytics and ecosystem packaging/documentation, with production deployment and domain cutover left for the final milestone.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This plan is divided into **3 incremental milestones**. The order is: Session Hardening & Abuse Controls → Analytics, SDKs, Docs & Community → Hosted Deployment & Domain Cutover.

## Milestone 1: Dashboard Session Hardening & Advanced Abuse Controls

Harden hosted dashboard authentication before wider rollout, then strengthen signup/auth abuse protections.

### Dashboard Session Hardening

The current dashboard stores the refresh token in `localStorage`. That is acceptable only as an MVP shortcut. Before wider hosted rollout, the dashboard should migrate to a cookie-based refresh model:

- refresh token stored in a `Secure` + `httpOnly` cookie in hosted mode
- access token remains memory-only in the dashboard runtime
- hosted dashboard API calls use `credentials: include` for refresh/logout flows
- logout clears both the cookie and the server-side session
- no refresh token remains readable through `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or other JS-visible browser storage in hosted mode

This migration is a prerequisite for production hosted go-live, not a late checklist item.

#### [MODIFY] `packages/sps-server/src/routes/auth.ts`

- hosted login/register/refresh responses set or rotate the refresh cookie instead of returning a JS-managed refresh token
- logout clears the refresh cookie and revokes the backing session
- cookie behavior is configured for hosted HTTPS deployment and fails closed in production if secure cookie requirements are not met

#### [MODIFY] `packages/dashboard/src/auth/AuthContext.tsx`

- remove refresh-token persistence from `localStorage`
- switch refresh/logout flows to cookie-backed requests
- keep the access token memory-only
- update E2E and component tests so the dashboard asserts the refresh token is not readable from JS-visible storage

### Advanced Abuse Controls

Strengthen protections beyond Phase 3A's per-IP rate limiting.

#### [MODIFY] Frontend: Cloudflare Turnstile Integration

- Add Turnstile challenge widget to `Register.tsx` and `Login.tsx`
- Dashboard sends the Turnstile response token with auth requests
- Backend validates the token server-side via Turnstile `/siteverify` before processing registration/login

#### [MODIFY] `packages/sps-server/src/routes/auth.ts`

- Add optional `cf_turnstile_response` field to register/login request bodies
- When `SPS_TURNSTILE_SECRET` is set, validate the token before auth processing
- When it is not set, skip challenge verification for local/dev

#### [MODIFY] `packages/sps-server/src/middleware/rate-limit.ts`

- Add anomaly burst detection: if a single workspace exceeds 5x its tier quota within a sliding hour window, emit an `abuse_alert` audit event and temporarily throttle to 1 req/min for that workspace
- Workspace-level throttle is self-clearing after the hour window passes

**Acceptance**: Hosted dashboard refresh handling no longer relies on JS-visible refresh-token storage. Login, refresh, and logout work through secure cookie-backed session flows in hosted mode. Turnstile blocks automated signup in hosted mode. Burst anomaly detection throttles and logs abuse attempts.

---

## Milestone 2: Analytics, SDKs, Documentation & Community

Add hosted operational analytics, then make the platform accessible to developers who are not reading source code directly.

### Analytics Page (`/analytics`)

Metadata-minimized, zero-knowledge-preserving workspace metrics:

- **Request volume**: daily secret request count over last 30 days
- **Exchange metrics**: successful vs. failed/expired/denied exchanges over last 30 days
- **Active agents**: count of agents that minted a JWT in the last 24 hours

### [NEW] `packages/sps-server/src/services/analytics.ts`

Backend aggregate queries over the `audit_log` table, scoped by `workspace_id`:

- `getRequestVolume(workspaceId, days)` → daily counts of `request_created` events
- `getExchangeMetrics(workspaceId, days)` → daily counts grouped by terminal status
- `getActiveAgentCount(workspaceId, hours)` → distinct `actor_id` where `actor_type = 'agent'`

All queries return counts and timestamps only. They never expose secret names, ciphertext, token values, or per-agent identifiers beyond aggregate counts.

### [NEW] `packages/sps-server/src/routes/analytics.ts`

| Endpoint | Auth | Behavior |
|----------|------|----------|
| `GET /api/v2/analytics/requests` | User JWT (admin/operator) | Daily request volume for last N days |
| `GET /api/v2/analytics/exchanges` | User JWT (admin/operator) | Daily exchange outcome metrics |
| `GET /api/v2/analytics/agents` | User JWT (admin/operator) | Active agent count |

RBAC: `workspace_viewer` cannot access analytics in the MVP.

### Language SDKs

Publish officially supported SDK packages that wrap the SPS API. **Node.js first**, then Python and Go.

| SDK | Package Name | Key Capabilities |
|-----|-------------|-----------------|
| **Node.js** | `@blindpass/sdk` | Published from existing `packages/agent-skill` with documentation, types, and npm release |
| **Python** | `blindpass` (PyPI) | HPKE keygen, secret request/retrieve, exchange request/fulfill/retrieve, bootstrap auth |
| **Go** | `github.com/tuthan/blindpass-go` | Same capabilities as Python SDK |

All SDKs must support:

- Bootstrap API key → JWT minting flow
- HPKE key generation and secret decryption
- Human→Agent: `requestSecret()`, `retrieveSecret()`
- Agent→Agent: `requestExchange()`, `fulfillExchange()`, `submitExchange()`, `retrieveExchange()`
- In-memory-only secret storage with explicit zeroing

### Documentation

| Document | Location | Content |
|----------|----------|---------|
| API Reference | `docs/api/` | OpenAPI 3.0 spec for all SPS routes, auto-generated from route schemas where possible |
| Quick Start | `docs/guides/quickstart.md` | 5-minute guide: register workspace → enroll agent → deliver first secret |
| Identity Bootstrap | `docs/guides/identity.md` | How to get an `ak_` key, mint JWTs, configure agent-skill |
| Policy Configuration | `docs/guides/policy.md` | Hosted workspace policy editor model, trust rings, secret registry, exchange policies, approval workflows, and self-hosted env bootstrap/default behavior |
| Self-Hosting | `docs/guides/self-hosting.md` | Docker Compose guide with env var reference and reverse proxy setup |

### Docker Compose Community Guide

Sanitize and publish the production Docker Compose setup:

- Remove operator-specific details
- Add `.env.example` with all required variables and sensible defaults
- Add `Makefile` with `make up`, `make down`, `make logs`, `make migrate` targets
- Include clear README with prerequisites (Docker, domain, DNS)

**Acceptance**: Node.js SDK publishes to npm. Python and Go SDKs install and complete the bootstrap → secret delivery flow against a running SPS instance. API documentation covers all hosted routes through Phase 3E, including workspace policy-management routes and guidance. Docker Compose community guide brings up a working stack from scratch.

---

## Milestone 3: Hosted Deployment & Domain Cutover

Stand up the production deployment with proper domains and TLS. This is the final hosted-launch milestone.

### Deployment Architecture

| Subdomain | Service | Container |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| `sps.atas.tech` | SPS API | `ghcr.io/tuthan/blindpass-sps-server` |
| `secret.atas.tech` | Browser UI (zero-knowledge sandbox) | `ghcr.io/tuthan/blindpass-browser-ui` |
| `app.atas.tech` | Operator Dashboard | `ghcr.io/tuthan/blindpass-dashboard` |

Reverse proxy and TLS are handled by the operator's existing Unraid reverse proxy (for example Nginx Proxy Manager or Traefik). No bundled reverse proxy is included.

### [NEW] `packages/sps-server/src/routes/health.ts`

| Endpoint | Auth | Behavior |
|----------|------|----------|
| `GET /healthz` | None | Returns `200` if server is up |
| `GET /readyz` | None | Returns `200` if PostgreSQL + Redis are reachable; `503` otherwise |

Health checks are used by Docker `HEALTHCHECK` and by the reverse proxy for upstream readiness.

### [MODIFY] `.github/workflows/build-and-push-images.yml`

- Add `dashboard` image build target (`ghcr.io/tuthan/blindpass-dashboard`)
- Pin `VITE_SPS_API_URL=https://sps.atas.tech` for production browser-ui and dashboard builds

### [MODIFY] `docs/deployment/Unraid.md`

- Add dashboard container template reference
- Update domain examples to `sps.atas.tech`, `secret.atas.tech`, `app.atas.tech`
- Document reverse proxy configuration for the three domains
- Add `SPS_HOSTED_MODE`, `SPS_TURNSTILE_SECRET`, and other Phase 3E env vars
- Clarify that `SPS_SECRET_REGISTRY_JSON` and `SPS_EXCHANGE_POLICY_JSON` are self-hosted bootstrap/default inputs, not the hosted per-workspace configuration path

### [NEW] `deploy/unraid/blindpass-dashboard.xml`

Unraid Docker template for the dashboard SPA container.

### DNS Setup

Create A or CNAME records for `sps.atas.tech`, `secret.atas.tech`, and `app.atas.tech` pointing to the Unraid host. TLS is managed by the operator's reverse proxy.

### Gateway Allowlist Update

Update the SPS egress URL filter allowlist to match the production domains:

- Secret input sandbox: `https://secret.atas.tech/*`
- Dashboard: `https://app.atas.tech/*` if links are ever sent in chat

**Acceptance**: All three subdomains serve over HTTPS with valid TLS. Health checks pass. Existing SPS operations work at the new URLs. Dashboard login/registration completes successfully against the production API. Gateway egress URL allowlist is verified.

## Infrastructure Changes

### Container Images

| Image | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `ghcr.io/tuthan/blindpass-sps-server` | Existing | Add health check endpoints + analytics routes |
| `ghcr.io/tuthan/blindpass-browser-ui` | Existing | Rebuild with production `VITE_SPS_API_URL` |
| `ghcr.io/tuthan/blindpass-dashboard` | New | Vite build, served via lightweight static server |
| `postgres:16-alpine` | Upstream | Production credentials via env |
| `redis:7-alpine` | Upstream | Unchanged |

### New Environment Variables

| Variable | Used By | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `SPS_TURNSTILE_SECRET` | sps-server | Cloudflare Turnstile server-side validation key |
| `SPS_AUTH_COOKIE_DOMAIN` | sps-server | Cookie domain for hosted refresh-session cookies |
| `VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` | dashboard | Turnstile widget site key baked into the build |
| `BILLING_PORTAL_RETURN_URL` | sps-server | URL to redirect after billing portal session (default: `https://app.atas.tech/billing`) |
| `VITE_SPS_API_URL` | dashboard, browser-ui | SPS API base URL baked at build time |

## Verification Plan

Detailed E2E and integration scenarios for this phase live in `docs/testing/Phase 3E.md`.

### Automated Tests

All tests use **Vitest**. Run from project root:

```bash
npm test
npm test --workspace=packages/sps-server
npm test --workspace=packages/dashboard
```

#### Milestone 1: hosted auth hardening and abuse-control coverage

- hosted login/register/refresh set or rotate the refresh cookie with the expected hosted security attributes
- dashboard refresh/logout flows work with cookie-backed auth and no refresh token in JS-visible storage
- logout clears the hosted refresh cookie and revokes the backing session
- Turnstile validation rejects invalid tokens when configured
- Burst anomaly detection triggers workspace throttle after 5x quota

#### Milestone 2: analytics, SDK integration, and documentation validation

- `getRequestVolume` returns correct daily counts from `audit_log`
- `getExchangeMetrics` groups by terminal status correctly
- `getActiveAgentCount` counts distinct actors within the time window
- Analytics endpoints return only caller-workspace data

- Node.js SDK bootstrap → request secret → retrieve flow succeeds
- Python SDK succeeds with the same hosted bootstrap and delivery flow
- Go SDK succeeds with the same hosted bootstrap and delivery flow
- OpenAPI spec validates against running server responses

#### Milestone 3: `health.test.ts` and deployment checks

- `GET /healthz` returns `200`
- `GET /readyz` returns `200` when PostgreSQL and Redis are reachable
- `GET /readyz` returns `503` when PostgreSQL or Redis is unavailable
- Production image builds pass CI
- All three subdomains resolve and serve with valid TLS
- Hosted login / refresh / logout work correctly with secure cookie-backed session auth at production URLs

### Manual Verification

1. **Session hardening**: log in to the hosted dashboard, verify no refresh token is readable from browser storage, refresh the page, and verify the session persists through the hosted cookie flow.
2. **Abuse controls**: attempt rapid-fire signups and verify Turnstile appears; trigger a burst and verify throttle + `abuse_alert`.
3. **Analytics**: generate traffic over several days and verify charts render on the analytics page.
4. **SDK quickstart**: follow the quickstart guide from a clean machine and verify first secret delivery succeeds.
5. **Production**: deploy all containers to Unraid and complete a full register → enroll agent → deliver secret flow at production URLs.

## Resolved Decisions

- **Dashboard refresh-token handling** → hosted mode must migrate refresh handling to `Secure` + `httpOnly` cookies before wider go-live; `localStorage` persistence is not the long-term hosted model
- **Turnstile** → Cloudflare Turnstile for signup/login challenge, gated by env var so local/dev can skip it
- **Analytics scope** → business-event counts and timestamps only; no secret names, ciphertext, token values, specific agent identifiers, or HTTP response-class telemetry
- **Hosted policy foundation** → workspace-scoped PostgreSQL policy lives in the separate Hosted Workspace Policy Foundation milestone and is a prerequisite for later hosted phases
- **SDK priority** → Node.js first, then Python, then Go
- **API documentation** → OpenAPI 3.0 spec; hand-written initially, auto-generation deferred
- **Reverse proxy** → operator-managed; no bundled reverse proxy
- **Domain strategy** → `app.atas.tech` for dashboard, `secret.atas.tech` for sandbox, `sps.atas.tech` for API
- **Launch ordering** → local hardening and ecosystem work land before production cutover

### Suggested Work Breakdown

1. Hosted cookie/session migration + dashboard auth updates + Turnstile + burst detection
2. Analytics backend + analytics UI + Node.js SDK publish + Python SDK + Go SDK + docs + community guide
3. Hosted deployment + domain cutover + health checks
